# Portfolio Automation System

## Project overview
Azure-native automated portfolio analysis and paper trade execution pipeline. Single-user personal system. NOT for live trading. All trade decisions require human approval via Teams adaptive card.

> **Open work / where we left off:** see [`FOLLOWUPS.md`](FOLLOWUPS.md) at the repo root.

## Architecture decisions (do not deviate without discussion)
- **Azure AI Foundry** for Claude API — project: Portfolio-Analysis, resource: resource-portfolio-analysis (East US 2, Claude not available in East US). API key auth (FoundryApiKey in KV). Endpoints in Function App settings: FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT, FOUNDRY_OPENAI_ENDPOINT. Model: claude-sonnet-4-6, temp 0.2
- **Alpaca paper account** is the canonical source of truth for portfolio positions and balances (`portfolio.positions[]`, `portfolio.balances`, `paper_account` block). Also used for Phase 2 paper-trade execution. REST API, no VM needed. (E*TRADE was removed in commit `bc60604` — its OAuth-1.0a tokens expired daily and the integration was dropped; `src/shared/clients/etrade.py` is dead code retained only as historical reference.)
- **FMP (Financial Modeling Prep)** for fundamentals, earnings, ETF look-through, EOD prices, stock news, and fallback congressional trades (senate/house) — free tier, 250 req/day
- **FRED** for macro indicators (35 series collected, including 6 labor-market series feeding `labor_signals` scorecard; `CHPMINDXM` deprecated — to revisit) — free, no practical limit
- **Quiver Quantitative** (primary alternative-data source) for congressional trades, lobbying, government contracts, wikipedia attention — hobbyist tier, `Authorization: Token <key>` header
- **Finnhub** for financial market news and company news — free tier, 60 calls/min
- **Azure AI Search** (Free tier) for semantic memory recall — Phase 1.5, after 60-90 days of data

## Key Vault secrets (7 active)
FmpApiKey, FredApiKey, AlpacaApiKey, AlpacaApiSecret, FoundryApiKey, FinnhubApiKey, QuiverApiKey

(Note: `MassiveApiKey` and the four `Etrade*` secrets may still exist in KV as soft-deletable leftovers from deprecated integrations — safe to delete manually. The collector no longer fetches them.)

If Alpaca is unreachable the collector falls back to `src/config/portfolio.json` (positions only — dollar gains will be zero in that mode).

## Data flow — Phase 1
1. Timer fires collector at 09:00 ET weekdays (NCRONTAB: `0 0 9 * * 1-5`, ET-local via `TZ=America/New_York` app setting — no DST drift). **NOTE**: this is Linux Consumption, so the IANA `TZ` setting is required. The Windows-only `WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE` is silently ignored on Linux and caused crons to fire 4.5h early (at 09:00 UTC = 05:00 ET) until commit 6f42f1a.
2. Collector reads secrets from Key Vault via Managed Identity
3. Collector calls Alpaca paper account (positions + balances drive the canonical `portfolio.positions[]` / `portfolio.balances`; `paper_account` block also retained with cash, buying_power, equity, last_equity, position list — falls back to `config/portfolio.json` if Alpaca unreachable), FMP (fundamentals, earnings, EOD prices, ETF data, stock news, fallback congressional), FRED (35 macro series, deep-history for bond + labor scorecards), Quiver (congressional trades, lobbying, gov contracts — **lobbying and gov_contracts are filtered client-side to portfolio tickers ∪ ETF watchlist and last 90 days; raw responses are ~20K rows/~16 MB and would blow past Claude's 1 M-token limit**), Finnhub (market news, company news)
4. Collector writes full JSON snapshot to `daily-snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD.json` blob
5. Collector writes denormalized rows to 6 Table Storage tables (PortfolioHistory, FundamentalsHistory, MacroHistory, ETFLookthroughHistory, SentimentHistory, TradeHistory)
6. Blob trigger fires analyzer
7. Analyzer reads today's snapshot + queries tables for historical trends + loads last 5 reports for continuity
8. Analyzer calls Claude via Foundry (Sonnet 4.6, temp 0.2, max_tokens 8000)
9. Analyzer parses response: markdown report + structured trade recommendations JSON
10. Writes report to `daily-reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, trades to `daily-trades/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
11. Outputs surfaced in `swa-pfauto` (no Logic App delivery; user pulls report via web UI). Optional email/OneDrive copies can be added later if needed.

## Data flow — Phase 2 (paper execution via Static Web App)
1. User signs into `swa-pfauto` with Entra ID work account (Easy Auth; allowed-role `owner`)
2. `/today` page renders the latest report (markdown) + a table of trade recommendations with per-row checkboxes
3. User selects 1…N trades and clicks **Approve selected** (bulk Approve button) or rejects
4. SWA managed API (`web/api/`) records the decision in `approvals/YYYY-MM-DD.json` and calls the `func-pfauto` executor endpoint (HMAC-signed payload, function master key fetched via SWA MI → Key Vault reference)
5. Executor validates, connects to Alpaca paper API, places orders (sells before buys)
6. Writes results to `daily-executions/YYYY-MM-DD.json` + TradeHistory table; SWA `/today` polls and shows execution status inline

## Table Storage schemas (6 tables)
- **PortfolioHistory**: PK=ticker, RK=date — positions, weights, P/L
- **FundamentalsHistory**: PK=ticker, RK=date — P/E, DCF, rating, earnings date
- **MacroHistory**: PK=series_id, RK=date — FRED values with deltas
- **ETFLookthroughHistory**: PK=etf_ticker, RK=date — holdings, country/sector allocation
- **SentimentHistory**: PK=date, RK=indicator — VIX, spreads, P/C ratios, percentiles
- **TradeHistory**: PK=year-month, RK=trade_id — full lifecycle from recommendation to 30/60/90d outcome. Phase C adds (write-once at recommendation, flex trades) the §7 reasoning enums `primary_trigger`/`thesis_type`/`trigger_evidence`/`catalyst_date`, and (stamped later by the collector at maturity) `price_at_rec`/`spy_at_rec`/`ret_Nd_pct`/`spy_ret_Nd_pct`/`excess_Nd_pp`/`call_correct_Nd`/`outcome_status`. Keys are **lowercase** across analyzer + executor + collector writes — Azure Tables is case-sensitive and upserts MERGE onto one entity (Phase C §9 casing fix).

## Snapshot analytics blocks (collector pre-computes; analyzer consumes)
Beyond raw API data, the collector injects pre-computed analysis blocks into each `daily-snapshots/{date}.json` so the analyzer reads conclusions, not raw series: `regional_rotation`, `bond_signals`, `labor_signals`, `market_shock`, and (Phase C) `performance` (account equity vs fully-invested SPY since inception + rolling 30/60/90d + `cash_pct`) and `track_record` (hit-rate by layer/trigger/thesis at the 60d headline + confidence calibration, aggregated from stamped TradeHistory rows). Phase C 7a also maintains a compact `performance/equity-series.json` blob (collector-owned cache: backfilled once from snapshots, then append-only). Planned (Open #10, specced not built): a `flex-stops/state.json` cache + `flex_stops` snapshot block for the volatility-scaled trailing stop.

## International holdings requiring special treatment
IDVO (international dividend + covered call overlay), IDMO (international momentum), AIA (Asia 50). Need: ETF look-through from FMP, international macro from FRED (EUR/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CNY, ECB rate, China PMI, Japan 10Y).

## Rules
- Never store secrets in code — always Key Vault with Managed Identity
- All functions emit custom metrics to App Insights
- Blob is source of truth; tables can be rebuilt from blobs (RUNBOOK-007)
- Human approval required for ALL **live** trade execution — no autonomous live trading. **Paper-only auto-execute** is enabled via app setting `AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED=true`: a 09:35 ET timer (`auto_executor`, NCRONTAB `0 35 9 * * 1-5`, ET-local via `TZ=America/New_York`) reads `daily-trades/{today}.json` and submits every recommendation to Alpaca paper, gated by Alpaca market clock (defers if closed). Executor applies a **defensive sell filter**: any sell against a symbol not currently held in the Alpaca paper account is dropped (status `not_held_in_paper_account`); requested qty larger than held is trimmed. Drops are recorded in `daily-executions/{date}.json` `skipped[]`.
- **One-time paper seeder** (`POST /api/seeder`): idempotent mirror of `config/portfolio.json` into Alpaca paper. Use `whole_shares_only=true` for off-hours seeding (Alpaca rejects fractional day-orders queued outside market hours — we floor qty to int, drop sub-1 tickers). Symbols already held OR with a pending open buy order are skipped (`skipped_already_held` / `skipped_open_order_pending`) so re-runs never duplicate. Per-run report written to `seeding/{utc_ts}.json`.
- Phase 1 must run clean 30+ days before Phase 2 is enabled
- Temperature 0.2 for Claude analysis calls (consistency)
- Sells execute before buys in multi-trade recommendations (free up cash)

## Deployment lessons (hard-won — see infra/modules/storage-roles.bicep + .github/workflows/deploy-code.yml)
- Function App MI requires **Storage Account Contributor** on the storage account in addition to Blob Data Owner / Queue Data Contributor / Table Data Contributor. Host startup calls `BlobServiceClient.GetPropertiesAsync()` which needs `blobServices/read`, not in the data-plane roles. Without it: persistent `AuthorizationPermissionMismatch 403`, host faults, zero functions registered.
- Workflow pip install MUST pin manylinux2014 wheels (`--platform manylinux2014_x86_64 --python-version 3.11 --implementation cp --only-binary=:all:`). GitHub `ubuntu-latest` ships GLIBC 2.39; Functions Linux Consumption image is older. Native wheels (e.g. `cryptography`) otherwise fail with `GLIBC_2.33 not found` and the Python worker silently fails to load.
- Deploy model: run-from-package via blob (`WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE=<blob URL>`). `func azure functionapp publish` does not work with identity-based `AzureWebJobsStorage`. App runs in read-only mode — portal Test/Run hits CORS; invoke via admin REST instead: `POST https://func-pfauto.azurewebsites.net/admin/functions/<name>` with master key from `az functionapp keys list`.
- Workflow path filter is `src/**`; workflow-only changes need manual `gh workflow run "Deploy function code" --ref master`.
- Quiver `/beta/live/lobbying` and `/beta/live/gov_contracts` return ~20K rows of all-market activity per call (~12 MB + ~4 MB JSON). Collector MUST filter client-side to portfolio tickers ∪ ETF watchlist AND last 90 days — otherwise the daily snapshot balloons to ~20 MB and the analyzer prompt blows past Claude's 1 M-token context window (observed: 6.2 M tokens → permanent 400). See `_row_ticker`/`_row_date` filter in `src/collector/handler.py` after the Quiver fetch. Commit `20cb2b0`.
- `host.json` `functionTimeout` is `00:40:00`. The old `00:10:00` was the **Consumption** plan max; on **Flex Consumption** the cap is far higher and the Foundry client allows up to 600 s/attempt × 3 retries, so 10 min could hard-kill the analyzer mid-Claude-call (no `Executed`, no exception, no report — just a silent recycle at the 10-min boundary). Large June snapshots (~1.2 MB / ~240K tokens) exposed this. Can also be overridden live without redeploy via the `AzureFunctionsJobHost__functionTimeout` app setting. Commits `743b5ad` (original), 2026-06-09 fix.
- **EventGrid blob-trigger `functionName` (Flex Consumption)**: the webhook URL in `deploy-code.yml` MUST use `functionName=Host.Functions.analyzer`, NOT bare `functionName=analyzer`. The bare form is accepted by `/runtime/webhooks/blobs` (HTTP 200, EventGrid reports DeliverySuccess) but cannot be routed to the registered listener, so the analyzer **never fires** and nothing errors — looks healthy end-to-end while silently dropping every event. Also requires the `Microsoft.EventGrid` resource provider to be **`Registered`** (not `Registering`) or storage publishes zero events (PublishSuccessCount=0). Diagnosed 2026-06-09.
- Runtime knobs `TZ=America/New_York`, `AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED=true`, and `AzureFunctionsJobHost__functionTimeout=00:40:00` now live **in `functionapp.bicep`** (IaC), so an `infra/**` deploy sets rather than wipes them. They were previously applied post-deploy, and an `az deployment group create` replaces the function app's app-setting set wholesale — which silently dropped them after the Flex migration and disabled the pipeline. Without `TZ`, crons run in UTC (collector 09:00 UTC = 05:00 ET; auto_executor 09:35 UTC = pre-market → defers forever). `AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED=true` in IaC intentionally overrides the "Phase 1 clean 30+ days" gate. Note: setting any app setting restarts the host — which is also what (re)connects Application Insights if telemetry has gone silent.
- **Editing `deploy-infra.yml` or `deploy-web.yml` self-triggers that deploy.** Both include their **own filename** in the push path filter (e.g. `paths: ['infra/**', '.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml']`), so a workflow-only edit to either fires a full deploy on push. `deploy-code.yml` is the exception — it filters on `src/**` only, so editing it does NOT trigger (needs manual `gh workflow run`). Consequence observed 2026-06-15: bumping action versions in all three YAMLs triggered an unintended infra + web deploy. The infra deploy re-applied unchanged Bicep and — per the SWA secret-wipe issue (FOLLOWUPS #2) — wiped the SWA's `STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` + `FUNC_MASTER_KEY`, breaking `/today` until restored via the #2 runbook. This was the **second** occurrence of that wipe; the permanent fix is moving those secrets to Key Vault references in `staticwebapp.bicep`. The trading pipeline was unaffected (func-app knobs are in Bicep). Also note: portfolio resources live in the **EasyGridsProduction** subscription (not the az CLI default) — management commands need `az account set --subscription EasyGridsProduction`; blob reads work from any default via `--auth-mode login`.
